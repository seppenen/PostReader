Front-end Assignment


The purpose of this assignment is to help evaluate your React and front-end development skills. We use this assignment to determine the level of your coding and where you might fit in our developer stack. There is no wrong answer or wrong way of doing this. Please try to do this by yourself. This task may take up to between 3-5 hours and should preferably be done in Typescript but Javascript is also okay. The final submission should meet production quality standards.
